<h3 id="coding-rules-tools-and-guides">Coding Rules, Tools and Guides</h3>
<p>Creating <em>good code</em> is the goal.  But what defines <em>good code</em>?  Coding rules and guidelines of course!  These ensure your code is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Repeatable:</strong> Other coders can use your code and get the same results.</li>
  <li><strong>Reliable:</strong> The code doesnâ€™t malfunction and it is not subject to outside threats or hacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistent:</strong> The code, data and functions associated with the code are the same structure throughout.</li>
  <li><strong>Testable:</strong> Holds up to rigorous review at the code level.</li>
  <li><strong>Portable:</strong> It works in <em>any</em> environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guides contained herein are my personal playbook.  They help keep me and my team on-track to help assist us achieve our goals.  In addition to the goals noted above, I would also like rules and guides that are</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accessible from Anywhere:</strong> Like many of you, I am not always at the same location or on the same device when/if I can work on code. The ability to whip out a phone/tablet etc. and work on something that jumps into my head at any point is key.</li>
  <li><strong>Safe:</strong> This goes without saying but <em>not</em> worrying about my files because they are backed-up in multiple locations is crucial.</li>
  <li><strong>Platform Agnostic:</strong> Not being tied to a specific platform tools or styles that work on one or a limited number of platforms is limiting.  Tools and style guides that work on as many platforms as possible is required.</li>
</ul>
