<p>I often hear that the “best traders” can take a random entry and profit by simply managing the trade and applying appropriate account management principles.  Through Monte Carlo analysis and other statistical tests applied to the random walk hypothesis, synthetic and actual stock data for stocks across the S&amp;P 500, I examine whether this is true or not for a limited number of post-entry management techniques, including random exits, profit-targets, stop-losses and trailing-stops.</p>
