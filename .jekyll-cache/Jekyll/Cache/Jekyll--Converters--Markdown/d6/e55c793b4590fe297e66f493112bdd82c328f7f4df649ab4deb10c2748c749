I"Â<p>I have been a subscriber to <a href="https://www.bespokepremium.com">Bespoke Premium</a> for a long time.  Tuesdays are always a special day; thatâ€™s when Bespoke Members get a fresh copy of the Bespoke Stock Scores Report.  This is their proprietary blend of Technical, Fundamental and Sentiment Analysis that is derived down to a single, weighted score.  I have always wanted to backtest their recommendations.  So I decided to do so in R.</p>
