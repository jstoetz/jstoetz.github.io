## Notes - Trading Options on Futures

I had to buy this book as a used hardcover copy but [Trading Options on Futures: Markets, Methods, Strategies, and Tactics](https://www.amazon.com/Trading-Options-Futures-Markets-Strategies/dp/0471606766) by John W. Labuszewski & John E. Nyhoff was worth the trouble.  Notes are below:

### Chapter 1:  Intro To Options

* Basic terminology and information on options on futures
* Options can be identified by 3 criteria:  type, class and series
  * Type: put or call
  * Class: options of the same type with common expiration dates.  Note that the expiration date must be distinguished from the exercise date - the exercise date is the day the option holder chooses to buy (call) or sell (put).
* ITM, ATM, OTM
* Risk and Return
  * holder can participate in favorable market conditions, risk is premium paid.  seller is the opposite
* Premium = Intrinsic Value (how much ITM) + Time Value

### Chapter 2:  Option Pricing Concepts

* Black-Scholes versus Cox-Ross Rubenstein
* 

### Chapter 3:  Risk, Reward and Probability
