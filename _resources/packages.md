## global packages that I use

## task views
-  [CRAN Task View:  Empirical Finance](https://cran.r-project.org/view=Finance)
-  [CRAN Task View:  Time Series Analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html)

## packages

### data
- [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/master/vignettes/dplyr.Rmd) is an R package that helps you manipulate and translate data.  Of all of the packages in R, dplyr is the one I use the most.

### data management

### risk management

### finance

### time series
- [zoo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html)
- [xts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html)

### design
- [knitr]()
- [rmarkdown]()
- [markdown]()
- [kable]()
"The ```kable()``` function in **knitr** is a very simple table generator, and is simple by design. It only generates tables for strictly rectangular data such as matrices and data frames."  It will output RMarkdown, HTML, LaTeX, and reStructuredText tables.

- [kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html)
A powerful package that helps you modify the simple tables you create with **kable**.  You can modify the style of each cell, column or row, even with logical statements.

### reporting
- [Performance Analytics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PerformanceAnalytics/index.html)
