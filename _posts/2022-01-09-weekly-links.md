### Austin Kleon — Ernest Becker, The Denial of Death Can’t decide if...

[Link](https://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/673283827511246848) - [DB](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r4l59wdgrtexz2h/Austin%20Kleon%20%E2%80%94%20Ernest%20Becker%2C%20The%20Denial%20of%20Death%20Can%E2%80%99t%20decide%20if....pdf?dl=0)

This book pops up on the radar from time to time. A real game changer if you have never read it. “It’s all about how our motivation in all things is the fear of death, hence we have to align ourselves with some greater symbolic power, a big lie from beyond, that allows us a sense of “cosmic specialness,” allows us to feel heroic, to deny death, to deny our ultimate fate as “complex and fancy worm food.” Religion, in the past, made this easy, providing a ready-made meaning-of-life and assurance of immortality if we followed the rules. Modernity has made it more difficult, more of a figure-it-out-yourself affair, and many of us struggle our whole lives to find (or invent) a kind of meaning we can believe in, to feel like we have some control over nature. Art is one way; for worse people, there’s war.”
