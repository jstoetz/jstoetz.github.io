Good answer using **httr** package to ```POST``` to the body of an API call.

    ""
  ],
  "startdate": "2020-03-01",
  "enddate": "2020-03-28",
  "regions": [
    0
  ]
}'

library(httr)
r <- POST("http://api.spending.gov.ua/api/rest/1.0/transactions", body=posting,
          httr::add_headers(`accept` = 'application/json'),
          httr::content_type('application/json')) #encode="json"

## HTML URL to PDF from R

### R Code to Transform HTML URL to PDF from R
<small>tags: cli</small>

I find myself recently with a lot of pages on the internet I need to save as a PDF for one reason or another.  Below is a short function that utilizes [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html) to save html pages as PDFs.  Note that you need to install wkhtmltopdf either by downloading form the website or on the command line via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/wkhtmltopdf#default).

```
# - visit https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html to install this on your system prior to running the function
# - set delay = TRUE if you want --javascript-delay <msec> to load the page and waid 200 msec

fn.save.url.to.pdf <- function(url, file_path, delay = F){
	command 				<- 		"wkhtmltopdf"
	url 						<- 		as.character(url)
	file_path 			<- 		file_path
	if(delay == T){
		delay = as.character("--javascript-delay 200")
	}
	if(delay == F){
		delay = as.character("")
	}
	cl 							<- 		paste0(command, delay, url, file_path, sep = " ")
	system(cl)
}
```
