This piece sums up parenting lately and the illusion of control that we think we all have:  

Back in September, I wrote about the way the pandemic has broken my sense of risk; after nearly two years of Covid calculations for me and my kids, I can describe myself only as dead inside (a feeling akin to what is described in one 2020 entry on the American Psychological Association website as ‚Äú‚Äòpsychic numbing,‚Äô indifference that sets in when we are confronted with overwhelming calamity‚Äù).

Even though my children are finally fully vaccinated, that anesthetized feeling persists. I thought everyday decision making for my family might get easier once we were all vaxxed, but we‚Äôre still trapped in the same cycle of trying to evaluate every minor event for individual and community risks and benefits and not always feeling equipped for that task.

### Parents Are Secretly Obsessed With Jellycat Stuffies üß∏

I wish I could have been long jellycats back before my kids were born based on the number we have accumulated. Even the author admits as much: ‚ÄúWhen I think about it too hard, I‚Äôm not sure if these amusing offerings are adorable little art pieces or the soft underbelly of late-stage capitalism.‚Äù
