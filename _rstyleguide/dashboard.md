## Introduction and Goals

### Coding Rules, Tools and Guides
Creating *good code* is the goal.  But what defines *good code*?  Coding rules and guidelines of course!  These ensure your code is:
- **Repeatable:** Other coders can use your code and get the same results.
- **Reliable:** The code doesn't malfunction and it is not subject to outside threats or hacks.
- **Consistent:** The code, data and functions associated with the code are the same structure throughout.
- **Testable:** Holds up to rigorous review at the code level.
- **Portable:** It works in *any* environment.

The guides contained herein are my personal playbook.  They help keep me and my team on-track to help assist us achieve our goals.  In addition to the goals noted above, I would also like rules and guides that are
- **Accessible from Anywhere:** Like many of you, I am not always at the same location or on the same device when/if I can work on code. The ability to whip out a phone/tablet etc. and work on something that jumps into my head at any point is key.
- **Safe:** This goes without saying but *not* worrying about my files because they are backed-up in multiple locations is crucial.
- **Platform Agnostic:** Not being tied to a specific platform tools or styles that work on one or a limited number of platforms is limiting.  Tools and style guides that work on as many platforms as possible is required.

The information herein incorporates many different sources but it is primarily based on [The tidyverse style guide by Hadley Wickham](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
